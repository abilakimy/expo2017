This is a Solar Panel project I did as a high school sophomore at Nazarbayev Intellectual School of Physics and Mathematics in Almaty with an ambitious goal of participating at Expo 2017 Astana: Future Energy. The goal of this project was to build a functional solar panel model.

Please note that the materials are presented in Russian language.
